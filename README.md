## Project Goal üéØ

Our primary goal is to simulate a real-world development workflow on a simplified scale. This project isn't about creating a complex application; it's about learning to work together effectively. We will focus on:

  * **Branching Strategy:** Creating and managing feature branches.
  * **Version Control:** Committing changes with clear, descriptive messages.
  * **Code Reviews:** Reviewing each other's pull requests to ensure code quality.
  * **Conflict Resolution:** Learning to resolve merge conflicts smoothly.

## How to Contribute ü§ù

1.  **Create a new branch** from `main` for your feature or task. Use a clear naming convention, like `feature/add-login-screen` or `bugfix/fix-button-color`.
2.  **Make your changes** and test them locally.
3.  **Commit your changes** with a meaningful commit message (e.g., "feat: Add user profile screen" or "fix: Resolve UI alignment issue").
4.  **Push your branch** to GitHub.
5.  **Create a Pull Request (PR)** to merge your branch back into `main`. .
6.  **Request a code review** from a team member.
7.  **Address any feedback** and merge your PR once approved.

Good luck and have fun\! üòä
